TECH:
non-visual:
- check chase cam behavior when target is located at camera location (division by zero?)
- choose compiler (MSVC/MinGW)
- full code review (note: watch behavior dependence on time between frames) - only camera code is left

visual:
- fix for wide screens
- small horizontal line at bottom of splash
- check font rendering - vertical lines visible between characters (left side of '1' on first line of info) - different in new freetype version
- review starmap point parameters (first parameter is 0, but it's 1 by default)
- check mipmapping (too many mipmaps?)
- improve splash status font (non-italic, use antialiasing instead of outline)
- antialiasing

performance/testing:
- compiler optimization switches (sse/sse2 ?)
- test on a remote machine (remote desktop)
- longevity testing (24h)

user:
- center the config dialog
- common controls are not looking good in release builds
- resources tagged as bulgarian in VS 2010
- check/redistribute MSVC C runtime library, check all other runtime dependencies (depends walker)
- update settings dialog - update or remove video mode selection, add website link?, antialiasing option (or 3rd detail level w/ implied antialiasing)?
- static preview has hard-coded dimensions in StaticPreview()
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version, check installer script logic (registry changes, etc?)
- installer uses Get/WritePrivateProfileString to select the default screen saver (maybe, see http://www.wischik.com/scr/howtoscr.html)
- update all files to match new company name and version (defs.h, , registry paths, installer script, manifest, splash, etc)
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver
- trial version


NON-TECH:
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower
- better texture for charon (and for moon?)
- replace monitor and wrench icons
- new splash screen
- company
- website
- new license (commercial)
