TECH:
non-visual:

visual:
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop) (med)

performance/testing:
- test for backplane clipping, correct z ordering from very far distances, also verify the system config, etc (high)
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

user:

misc:
- add a table of contents, system requirements, and known issues sections to the readme; mention WinXP SP2 & IE 4.0 in the system requirements (high)
