tech:
- full code review (note: watch resource deallocation on error)
- find memory leaks (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x98tx3cf%28VS.80%29.aspx) - reported allocations in CNameTree::NewNode() and bodycache allocation in CBody::Load()
- profile to improve startup time (and in-game performance); startup time is 71% in CLoader::LoadImage() and 24% in CLoader::LoadTexture(); in-game time is spent mostly in CStarMap::DrawStars() and performance is greatly improved by fixing the starmap displaylist
- missing checks malloc() NULL return
- check cpu and memory usage
- check debugging capabilities, error handling and reporting
- check info display list recording - glEndList() is called in CInfo::Start() instead of in CInfo::MakeInfo() and in CInfo::MakeName(), and is called only after CInfo::MakeInfo()
- compiler optimization switches (sse/sse2 ?)
- export some lighting parameters into files - reflectivities,etc.
- asteroid darkening seems to be hard-coded in Body.cpp as ASTEROID_REFLECTION
- check mipmapping
- generate equally-spaced sphere vertexes
- run through a heap corruption detector
- rewrite/simplify some parts (error logging?)
- new DRS file creator program/script
- per-user settings? and assume data dir is working dir
- replace DRS files with something else/more standard (?) - zip?
- antialiasing
- test/fix for wide screens
- test on integrated/intel cards - suspect starmap and fonts display
- improve graphics performance (?) - slow on integrated video cards (frustum culling?)
- update settings dialog - update or remove video mode selection, add website link?
- trial version
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version
- check/redistribute MSVC C runtime library
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver
- longevity testing (24h)

non-tech:
- new splash screen
- better polar coord textures - moon sucks
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?)
- replace monitor and wrench icons
- new license (commercial)
- company name
