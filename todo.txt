tech:
- port to MinGW and remove GLAUX dependency
- division by zero in CSettings::RandomizeDataFile()
- correct "if (b=false)" in CLoader::LoadTexture()
- buffer overflow: in CBody::Load(), numbodies is used before being calculated; the allocated buffer is of zero length, and is overflown in CBody::Reload()
- datadir defaults to current dir
- unnecessary CSettings::WriteConfigRegistry() in WinMain()
- check cpu and memory usage
- check debugging capabilities, error handling and reporting
- check font scaling - makes smaller fonts worse (info lines)
- check font rendering - vertical lines visible between characters (left side of '1'); characters like 'M' and 'd' seem sharp on the far right vertical line
- check mipmapping
- full code review
- check all compiler warnings, especially an assignment in an if condition
- fix CLoader::LoadImage() - looks like hGlobal is not released/freed, could leak memory
- find memory leaks (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x98tx3cf%28VS.80%29.aspx) - reported allocations in CNameTree::NewNode() and bodycache allocation in CBody::Load()
- profile to improve startup time (and in-game performance)
- run through a heap corruption detector
- rewrite/simplify some parts (error logging?)
- new DRS file creator program/script
- per-user settings?
- replace DRS files with something else/more standard (?) - zip?
- antialiasing
- test/fix for wide screens
- test on integrated/intel cards - suspect starmap and fonts display
- improve graphics performance (?) - slow on integrated video cards (frustum culling?)
- update settings dialog - update or remove video mode selection, add website link?
- trial version
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver
- longevity testing (24h)

non-tech:
- new splash screen
- better polar coord textures - moon sucks
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?)
- replace monitor and wrench icons
- new license (commercial)
- company name
