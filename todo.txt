tech:
- port to MinGW and remove GLAUX dependency
- division by zero in CSettings::RandomizeDataFile()
- correct "if (b=false)" in CLoader::LoadTexture()
- buffer overflow: in CBody::Load(), numbodies is used before being calculated; the allocated buffer is of zero length, and is overflown in CBody::Reload()
- datadir defaults to current dir
- unnecessary CSettings::WriteConfigRegistry() in WinMain()
- check cpu and memory usage
- check debugging capabilities, error handling and reporting
- full code review
- check all compiler warnings, especially an assignment in an if condition
- fix CLoader::LoadImage() - looks like hGlobal is not released/freed, could leak memory
- profile to improve startup time (and in-game performance)
- rewrite/simplify some parts (error logging?)
- new DRS file creator program/script
- per-user settings?
- replace DRS files with something else/more standard (?) - zip?
- antialiasing
- test/fix for wide screens
- test on integrated/intel cards - suspect starmap and fonts display
- improve graphics performance (?) - slow on integrated video cards (frustum culling?)
- update settings dialog - update or remove video mode selection, add website link?
- trial version
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver
- longevity testing (24h)

non-tech:
- new splash screen
- better polar coord textures - moon sucks
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower
- replace monitor and wrench icons
- new license (commercial)
- company name
