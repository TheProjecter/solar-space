TECH:
non-visual:
- set internal texture format to RGB, when not using an alpha map, to conserve video memory (high)

visual:
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop) (med)
- do not rotate rings (maybe) (high)
- check jerky movement of some bodies (Europa) when zoomed in; use double precision where applicable, check and remove the comment about min body size in the body data file (high)

performance/testing:
- test all settings (low)
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

user:

misc:
- credit Harwen Zhang for his icon; see http://harwen.net/ (high)
- mark authors of 3rd party products and add links (in a new text file); install the new file; menstion new file in change log (high)
- add moon map 4k; check md5 sums and remove original 3rd party resources(high)
- rearrange authors file (high)
- review data files (file names, lowercase, comments, etc) (high)


NON-TECH:
- consider removing Charon (med)
- consider adding Rhea (med)
- adjust body sizes and distances, check for possible body collisions (none now), keep in mind jupiter is too close to saturn (med)
- check all data (names, info facts, body data) (med)
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?); check specular reflection too (maybe) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (maybe) (med)
- adjust camera parameters (movement, orientation and zoom speeds, duration, etc) (maybe) (med)
- adjust info window parameters (fade time) (maybe) (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- final review of change log - add any missing items, change existing ones if necessary (low)
- check spelling of all text files (low)
- update website (downloads, screenshots, etc.) and upload binaries to all "mirrors" (vsemionov.org, bitbucket, sf, google?) (low)
