TECH:
visual:
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop), mention in change log (high)
- specify ring rotation with the time of year, not the time of day, mention in the change log (med)
- why is the sun not obscured by rings (lens flare is shown) (high)
- note that radius is width for a ring spec, note in change log (high)
- check jerky movement of some bodies (Europa) when zoomed in; use double precision where applicable, check and remove the comment about min body size in the body data file, removed "planned" marker from change log (high)
- consider adjusting the specular spot size per-planet, depending on distance from Sun, mention in change log (high)
- check again the reason for choosing GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR; update change log if changes are made again, or if not - explain the nature of the mentioned "adjustment" (high)

non-visual:
- set internal texture format to RGB, when not using an alpha map, to conserve video memory, mention in change log (high)
- extend d2 for extraction (high)

performance/testing:
- test all variants of star map rendering on the laptop (high)
- test all settings (low)
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

user:
- install d2, mention in change log (high)

misc:
- mark authors of 3rd party products and add links (in a new text file, e.g. acknowledgements); install the new file; mention new file in change log (high)
- rearrange authors file (high)
- acknowledge Harwen Zhang for his icon; see http://harwen.net/ (high)
- acknowledge JPL/Caltech for the Charon texture map; see http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/policy/ (high)
- mention author and license in readme (high)
- maybe change the title of the "miscellaneous" section in the readme (high)
- mention in change log that asteroids are not randomly rotated (high)
- review data files (check file names for correctness, filename lowercase, use dashes instead of underscores in filenames, review text comments, etc), mention in change log if changed (med)


NON-TECH:
- try to find a better moon texture with no visible shadows; see http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/moon/moon_8k_color_brim16.jpg and http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/creators/hermes/moon-4k.zip from http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html and http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/moon.php, respectively; find and acknowledge original authors; mention in change log (med)
- adjust body sizes and distances, check for possible body collisions (none now), keep in mind jupiter is too close to saturn (med)
- check all data (names, info facts, body data) (med)
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?); check specular reflection too (maybe) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (maybe) (med)
- adjust camera parameters (movement, orientation and zoom speeds, duration, etc) (maybe) (med)
- adjust info window parameters (fade time) (maybe) (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- final review of all text files; add any missing change log items, change existing ones if necessary, watch for "planned" markers (low)
- check spelling of all text files (low)
- update website (downloads, screenshots, etc.) and upload binaries to all "mirrors" (vsemionov.org, bitbucket, sf, google?) (low)
