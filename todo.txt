TECH:
non-visual:

visual:
- homogenous distribution of random stars; check other random distributions (high)
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop) (med)

performance/testing:
- test all dialogs (including preview) (low)
- test for backplane clipping, correct z ordering from very far distances, also verify the system config, etc (med)
- test by terminating application while run by windows as a screensaver; also by showing the error log dialog, before and after opening the saver window, without terminating (high)
- test on a remote machine (remote desktop) (low)
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

user:
- error log dialog not shown (entire screen is black) after closing the main window when run as a screensaver by windows; try creating the dialog as a child of the main window before closing the latter; if no other options are found, do not display this dialog after creating the main window (high)
- save the log to a non-temp file under %APPDATA% (see SHGetSpecialFolderPath()) (high)

misc:


NON-TECH:
- fix graphics (resize again the original images with the bicubic sharper method; try to reduce the luminosity at the edges of Sun's flare) (med)
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (med)
- adjust camera parameters (movement, orientation and zoom speeds, duration, etc) (med)
- adjust info window parameters (fade time) (med)
- replace monitor and wrench icons (med)
- logo (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- new preview image (could be a logo, screenshot, or other; but preferably a logo) (maybe) (med)
- update website (downloads, screenshots, etc.) (med)
