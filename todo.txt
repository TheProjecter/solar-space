visual:
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop) (med)
- do not rotate rings (high)
- jerky movement of some bodies (Europa) when zoomed in (high)

performance/testing:
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

user:

- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (med)
- adjust camera parameters (movement, orientation and zoom speeds, duration, etc) (med)
- adjust info window parameters (fade time) (med)
- replace monitor and wrench icons (med)
