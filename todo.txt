TECH:
non-visual:
- update clock colon only when necessary (high)
- full code review (note: watch behavior dependence on time between frames) - only camera code is left (high)
- check chase cam behavior when target is located at camera location (division by zero?) (high)
- automated code format (med)
- window not positioned properly in debug mode (non-client area is outside the viewport) (low)

visual:
- try generated starmaps (high)
- review starmap point parameters (first parameter is 0, but it's 1 by default) (high)
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop) (med)

performance/testing:
- test on a remote machine (remote desktop) (low)
- longevity testing (>48h) (low)

user:
- review all English messages (med)
- rename the "Show planet info" option (to e.g. "Information window") (med)
- check/redistribute MSVC C runtime library, check all other runtime dependencies (depends walker) (med)
- redesign settings dialog - merge desktop resolution option into the video modes group, add website link(?), other enhancements, registration info (med)
- update the show log dialog - make it wider and possibly add an icon (med)
- update button heights of all dialogs to the default (med)
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version, check installer script logic (registry changes, etc?) (med)
- installer uses Get/WritePrivateProfileString to select the default screen saver (maybe, see http://www.wischik.com/scr/howtoscr.html) (med)
- update all files to match new company name and version (defs.h, , registry paths, installer script, manifest, splash, etc) (med)
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver (med)
- update all version information (to 1.2.0) (low)

misc:
- generate .scr instead of .exe at build time (low)
- map D:\Documents\work to Z:\ and update absolute directory paths in the project (low)


NON-TECH:
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (med)
- get high resolution Earth textures (maybe, check compatibility) (med)
- better texture for Charon (and for Moon?) (med)
- replace monitor and wrench icons (med)
- logo (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- new preview image (could be a logo, screenshot, or other; but preferably a logo) (maybe) (med)
