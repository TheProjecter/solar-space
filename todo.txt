tech:
- consider removing the reallyclose flag and relying on wm_close (also remove other unnecessary logic in the window proc, remove pre-NT manual handling - passwords, etc)
- change object type load order (splash, bodies, lensflares, starmap, clock)
- check for user abort after loading objects instead of/as well as before loading them
- test on a remote machine (remote desktop)
- full code review (note: watch resource deallocation on error)
- profile to improve startup time (and in-game performance); startup time is 71% in CLoader::LoadImage() and 24% in CLoader::LoadTexture(); in-game time is spent mostly in CStarMap::DrawStars() and performance is greatly improved by fixing the starmap displaylist
- check cpu and memory usage
- check debugging capabilities, error handling and reporting
- write the log to a temp file, not to the data dir
- check if work machine renders info correctly if it is not implemented with (recursive) display lists
- check font rendering - vertical lines visible between characters (left side of '1' on first line of info)
- compiler optimization switches (sse/sse2 ?)
- export some lighting parameters into files - reflectivities,etc.
- asteroid darkening seems to be hard-coded in Body.cpp as ASTEROID_REFLECTION
- check mipmapping
- improve splash status font (non-italic, use antialiasing instead of outline)
- new DRS file creator program/script; also change header string in the DRS format
- per-user settings? only data dir is in global registry?
- antialiasing
- test/fix for wide screens
- test on integrated/intel cards - suspect starmap and fonts display
- improve graphics performance (?) - slow on integrated video cards (frustum culling?)
- update settings dialog - update or remove video mode selection, add website link?, antialiasing option?
- trial version
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version, check installer script logic (registry changes, etc?)
- check/redistribute MSVC C runtime library, check all other runtime dependencies (depends walker)
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver
- longevity testing (24h)

non-tech:
- new splash screen
- better polar coord textures - moon sucks
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?)
- replace monitor and wrench icons
- new license (commercial)
- company name
