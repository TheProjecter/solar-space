TECH:
non-visual:
- fix dialog window message control flow (high)
- check chase cam behavior when target is located at camera location (division by zero?) (med)
- window not positioned properly in debug mode (non-client area is outside the viewport) (low)
- full code review (note: watch behavior dependence on time between frames) - only camera code is left (med)

visual:
- fix for wide screens (high)
- small horizontal line at bottom of splash - caused by lower part of splash (med)
- check font rendering - vertical lines visible between characters (left side of '1' on first line of info) - different in new freetype version (high)
- review starmap point parameters (first parameter is 0, but it's 1 by default) (med)
- check mipmapping (too many mipmaps?) (med)
- improve splash status font (non-italic, use antialiasing instead of outline) (high)
- antialiasing (high)

performance/testing:
- test on a remote machine (remote desktop) (low)
- longevity testing (24h) (low)

user:
- rename the "Show planet info" option (to e.g. "Information window") (med)
- check/redistribute MSVC C runtime library, check all other runtime dependencies (depends walker) (med)
- redesign settings dialog - add website link(?), antialiasing option, other enhancements, registration info (med)
- update installer to latest InnoSetup version, check installer script logic (registry changes, etc?) (med)
- installer uses Get/WritePrivateProfileString to select the default screen saver (maybe, see http://www.wischik.com/scr/howtoscr.html) (med)
- update all files to match new company name and version (defs.h, , registry paths, installer script, manifest, splash, etc) (med)
- installer asks before setting solar space as the default screen saver (med)
- trial version (med)

misc:
- generate .scr instead of .exe at build time (low)
- map D:\Documents\work to Z:\ and update absolute directory paths in the project (low)


NON-TECH:
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (med)
- better texture for charon (and for moon?) (med)
- replace monitor and wrench icons (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- new preview image (could be a logo, screenshot, or other; but preferably a logo) (maybe) (med)
- company (med)
