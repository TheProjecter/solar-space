TECH:
visual:
- research specular highlights on all planets (found on Deso's laptop), mention in change log (high)

non-visual:

performance/testing:
- test all settings (low)
- verify all bodies render fine, in both camera modes (low)
- longevity testing (the release configuration) (with camera transition times decreased) (>48h) (low)

NON-TECH:
- try to find a better moon texture with no visible shadows; see http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/moon/moon_8k_color_brim16.jpg and http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/creators/hermes/moon-4k.zip from http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html and http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/moon.php, respectively; find and acknowledge original authors; mention in change log; mention author in thanks (med)
- adjust body sizes and distances, check for possible body collisions (none now), keep in mind jupiter is too close to saturn (med)
- adjust lens flare colors (the should be no browns like now, only colors of the rainbow) (med)
- adjust ambient reflection (e.g. to 0.1?); check specular reflection too (maybe) (med)
- adjust body parameters so that planets rotate slower (maybe) (med)
- adjust camera parameters (movement, orientation and zoom speeds, duration, etc) (maybe) (med)
- adjust info window parameters (fade time) (maybe) (med)
- check all data (names, info facts, body data) (med)
- new splash screen (med)
- final review of all text files; add any missing change log items, change existing ones if necessary, watch for "planned" markers, review entries that are too irrelevant (low)
- check spelling of the content of all text files (low)
- update website (downloads, screenshots, etc.) and upload sources and binaries to all "mirrors" (vsemionov.org, bitbucket, sf, google?) (low)
- update development sites (source, screenshots, etc) (low)
- promote project - list in software directories, video in youtube (also available shown on the website), other promotions (low)
