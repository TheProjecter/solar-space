Version 1.2:
graphics:
 - correct rendering on screen resolutions other than 4:3 (widescreen 16:9, 5:4, etc.)
 - anti-aliasing in the high graphics level
 - anisotropic filtering in the high graphics level
 - improved rendering of the stars from the Yale catalog - enhanced colors and correct positions
 - enhanced positioning, sizing, spacing and rendering of info text fonts and window
 - anti-aliased splash screen status text font
 - slightly sharper planet textures
 - (planned) enhanced general look and feel - tuned planet sizes and distances, rotation periods, ambient light intensity, star brightness, camera movement, info window size and fade duration
 - new splash screen, preview image and icons
 - camera state is completely independent of frame rate
 - Z buffer depth is 32 bits if available, but 16 bits otherwise
 - OpenGL texture filter is GL_NEAREST for all overlays
 - updated load order (splash, bodies, star map, lens flares, info fonts, clock)
 - clock colon state is updated more correctly, on every frame
 - updated FreeType to version 2.3.5
data:
 - (planned) updated object facts/information
 - asteroid models are not orientated randomly
 - rings rotation is specified with the orbit period field
 - initial cloud rotation angle is random if specified as zero
 - the d2 data file archiver utility is distributed
 - data files are in a new format (d2)
 - added a format version field to the planetary system specification for future compatibility purposes
usability:
 - new and updated UI elements - about box, website link, enhancements to existing elements
 - the default video mode, when not using the desktop resolution, is 1024x768
 - new graphics setting, medium, which lacks anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering
 - no initial flicker when showing the preview image
 - per-user configuration
 - changed path to the configuration data in the Windows registry
 - updated Inno Setup to version 5.4.2
 - custom installer/uninstaller icon (same as the new application icon)
 - setting as the current screen saver at installation time is optional
 - the installer never changes any screen saver properties, except the screen saver program
 - the uninstaller does not unset the current screen saver
 - DLL dependencies are installed in the application directory and loaded dynamically at run-time
 - version info, copyright and other information in the installer and application executables
 - the settings dialog is properly centered
 - improved log levels and messages
 - the error log dialog is never shown
 - a log file from the last run is always saved in the per-user application data directory
 - spelling corrections, changes to English messages
performance:
 - improved performance of star map rendering (by fixing a bug that disabled an optimization)
 - increased timer resolution
 - to conserve video memory, textures with no alpha channel are stored in memory in RGB format (not RGBA)
 - slight optimizations to the loading of textures at initialization time (image not loaded twice if texture and alpha maps are the same file)
stability:
 - fixed memory leaks, segmentation faults and divisions by zero
 - improved handling of Windows-related events (window messages)
development:
 - official binaries built with Visual Studio 2010
 - the MinGW compiler is supported
 - changed the version control system to Mercurial
 - moved the development website and repository to https://bitbucket.org/vsemionov/solar-space
misc:
 - improved documentation - new readme, changes, authors and license files
 - moved the main website to http://www.vsemionov.org/solar-space/
 - New BSD License
 - various other fixes and improvements in most aspects

Version 1.1:
 - not released to avoid confusion with version 1.01, which uses the old naming scheme

 - minor changes to installer

Version  1.0:
 - initial release
