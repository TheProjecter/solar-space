Version 1.2:
graphics:
 - correct rendering on screen resolutions other than 4:3 (widescreen 16:9, 5:4, etc.)
 - anti-aliasing in the high graphics level
 - anisotropic filtering in the high graphics level
 - improved rendering of the stars from the Yale catalog - enhanced colors and correct positions
 - enhanced positioning, sizing, spacing and rendering of info text fonts and window
 - anti-aliased splash screen status text font
 - slightly sharper planet textures
 - (planned) enhanced general look and feel - tuned planet sizes and distances, rotation periods, ambient light intensity, star brightness, camera movement, info window size and fade duration
 - new splash screen, preview image and icons
 - smoother animation via double-precision calculations of object and camera position and orientation
 - camera state is completely independent of frame rate
 - Z buffer depth is 16 bits
 - slight adjustment to the OpenGL texture filter selection
 - updated load order (splash, bodies, star map, lens flares, info fonts, clock)
 - clock colon state is updated more correctly
 - updated FreeType to version 2.3.5
data:

 - added a format version field to the planetary system specification
usability:
 - new and updated UI elements - about box, website link, enhancements to existing elements
 - the default video mode, when not using the desktop resolution, is 1024x768
 - new graphics setting - medium
 - no initial flicker when showing the preview image
 - per-user configuration
 - changed path to the configuration data in the Windows registry
 - updated Inno Setup to version 5.4.2
