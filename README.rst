Overview
========
Solar Space is a three-dimensional, animated screen saver for Windows, showing a view of the Solar System. It is written in C++ and uses the OpenGL and FreeType libraries. Its features are:

* Visually appealing - high-resolution realistic graphic textures and models, effects like lens flares, reflections from oceans and ice, semi-transparent cloud layers, etc. The appearance and proportions of objects were carefully designed for a balance between realism and aesthetics.
* Complex camera movement - the camera tracks either the whole Solar system, or individual objects for a predefined period of time. Afterwards, it randomly picks a new view, smoothly moves to its destination position, and adjusts its orientation and zoom.
* About 20 objects of different type - the Sun, all planets and most of their well-known moons, rings, irregularly-shaped bodies like Phobos and Deimos.
* A background full of stars - each star on the background corresponds to a real star. The star data is acquired from Yale's bright star catalog, containing information on over 9100 stars.
* Highly customizable - all objects and their properties can be modified by editing the planetary system definition files.
* Extensible - besides the Solar system, new planetary systems can easily be added by creating a package containing the object hierarchy definition, the textures and models, and the star map file. The active package is selected from the program's configuration interface, integrated with the screen saver settings in the Windows control panel.
* Easy to install - the whole package is distributed as a single-file installer, which presents the user with a well-known installer wizard interface.
