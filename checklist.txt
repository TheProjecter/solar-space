Release Checklist:
- replace the headers and binaries of all dependencies before building, just in case
- build the project from location D:\work\solar-space or some other pretty path that contains no user-specific components (this absolute path is contained in the final .exe as the path to the PDB)
- save the generated PDB files and import them in version control, alongside the .exe file (but do not distribude them)
