Release Checklist:
- check newest dependency versions
- replace the headers and binaries of all dependencies before building, just in case
- build the project from location Z:\solar-space or some other pretty path that contains no user-specific components (this absolute path is contained in the final .exe as the path to the PDB)
- create 2-3 builds and verify that only a few bytes differ in the .exe file (probably some timestamp)
- save the generated PDB files and import them (in version control) alongside the .exe file (but do not distribute them)
